Keeping track of 9 units in Pixel Tactics could be troublesome, this might help.
<br>
In the event that you don't have/don't want to break out/deal with the little health tokens (some actualy varry in size), hopefully this will help keep track of the stats of your units. Also, there are cases where attack strenghts get alterd as well.

<br> This simple little web-app could be your solution. 

Pixel Tactics is property of Level99 games.
This web-app is coded by myself MrChido in an effort to keep me coding and to build my portfolio with somewhat practical exercises in mind.
